# UnityNiDotNet

My personal workspace for messing with a Unity <-> LEGO Universe pipeline.

## Includes
In various stages of complete, bug free, and user friendly.

##### A Nif Importer
Open then UniverseImporter in Window -> Universe Importer
Works on a majority of .nif files from LU. Skinned meshes are broken.

##### A Luz Importer
Open then UniverseImporter in Window -> Universe Importer
Reads the Luz file and Lvl files and assembles them into a scene.
First let it import once, than delete the luz file, and reimport to place everything in the scene.

##### A Raw Importer
Have a terrain in the scene, than just drag a .raw file into the assets. Heights can be all of the place.

##### A makeshift FDB editor
Open the NiDotNet scene and click play.
